Packages
--------
There are none avaiable yet, this software is still a work-in-progress. Therefore, you have to compile it yourself.
For this reason, probably do not use this in production environments yet, there's still a lot of work that needs to be done!

About
--------
This web application allows a user to create their own "Asset Types" and add Assets to each type to track them.

Assets can be anything, from house plants, to computers on a network.  Each asset contains various user-defined attributes which allows flexibility.

Features
--------
 * Can dynamically create asset types that contain user-defined attributes.
 * Able to connect to multiple database sources.
 * Able to connect to multiple database types (e.g. can do both SqLite and MS SqlServer).
